# The-Virtual-Augmented-Reality-War

I conducted a sentiment analysis using a synthetic dataset of VR/AR headset reviews created by Leo Walker (https://github.com/leowalker89). The goal was to gain insights into user sentiments and preferences related to these technologies. For this analysis, I utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, TextBlob, and Matplotlib.

The analysis consisted of two parts:

Overall Sentiment Analysis:
In this part, we analyzed the overall sentiment of the VR/AR headset reviews. We explored whether the sentiment was predominantly positive, negative, or neutral.
Product-Wise Sentiment Analysis:
For the second part, we delved deeper into individual products within the dataset.
We performed sentiment analysis on each productâ€™s reviews separately, allowing us to understand how users perceived specific VR/AR headsets.
